Transit,Overview,"VISION 2050 calls for providing and encouraging alternatives to driving alone and ensuring the availability of reliable and competitive transit options. With the adoption of a transit-focused Regional Growth Strategy, complete implementation of a comprehensive, integrated transit system will be critical. The region’s transit  system is built upon the backbone of an extensive bus transit system with an expanding high-capacity transit system."
Transit,Overview-HCT,"High-capacity transit in the region is provided by a variety of rail, bus rapid transit and ferry modes, including Sound Transit’s Link light rail, Tacoma Link, and Sounder commuter rail, Seattle’s two streetcar lines and the historic 1962 monorail, Community Transit’s Swift and King County Metro’s RapidRide bus rapid transit services, and multimodal and passenger-only ferry services provided by the Washington State Ferries, Pierce County Ferries and King County."
Transit,Overview-Agency,There are eight agencies that provide fixed-route transit service in the Central Puget Sound Region. Links to each of these agencies is provided on this page. These agencies coordinate their long-range planning efforts with PSRC and the key priorities in each agency's long range plan are incorporated in the Regional Transportation Plan.
Transit,Overview-HowTo,"This dashboard is updated throughout the calendar year and is based on three key sources of data.<br><br><ul><li>National Transit Data (NTD) Monthly Performance Data</li><li>Spring & Fall service change data via agency GTFS</li><li>Washington State Office of Financial Management Small Area Estimates Program</li></ul>The dashboard pages are organized by the level of summarization that an individual might be interested in, starting at the regional level and going down to summarizations of data by transit stops. The pages can be accessed by the links along the top of the dashboard. The key metrics included in the dashboard include <b>boardings, revenue-hours, revenue-miles and boardings per hour.</b> The six different dashboard pages are:<br><br><ul><li><b>Region:</b> Summarizes the four key transit performance metrics for all modes and operators in King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish counties.</li><li><b>Mode:</b> Summarizes the four key transit performance metrics by transit modes for all operators in King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish counties. </li><li><b>Operator:</b> Summarizes the four key transit performance metrics by operator for all transit modes.</li><li><b>Type:</b> Summarizes the number of people that live within either 1/4 or 1/2 mile of a transit stops by type of transit and population of interest.</li><li><b>Frequency:</b> Summarizes the number of people that live within either 1/4 or 1/2 mile of a transit stops by number of transit trips per hour and population of interest.</li><li><b>Routes:</b> A map of transit routes color coded by transit type from the latest service change data.</li></ul> The <b>Region, Mode and Operator</b> pages are based on NTD data and are updated monthly, generally by the 15th of the month but dependent on the latest release of data by the Federal Transit Administration. The <b>Type, Frequency, and Routes</b> pages are updated twice per year, once in the fall after the Fall service change and once in the spring after the spring service change."
